# About

I made these notebooks whilst learning the deep learning framework PyTorch in Aug 2022. These are intended as tutorials for others to learn from as well. Originally posted on Kaggle ([see here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/samuelcortinhas/catalogue-of-my-kaggle-notebooks#pytorch)).

# Structure

There are 5 notebooks in total: 

* PT1 - Linear Regression with PyTorch
* PT2 - Logistic Regression with PyTorch
* PT3 - Neural Networks with PyTorch
* PT4 - CNNs with PyTorch
* PT5 - Save & load models with PyTorch
